The way the PModel:modelByPrimaryId(--wanted id number---, database), returns what's inside the PModel for a certain ID

I want instead of returning what inside model, to retrun what inside the dependencies, i.e. representationType and  strucutreTechnique

constructor/descruptor 
-- For the Warning (inheretge etc)
	-- the descrucotr ~PModel must virtual 


-- Put 	
virtual std::string sqlIdName()
{
	return staticSqlIDName(); 	
}
to Object, bevause is Used to every retrieving


-- Need to INSERT something to BondBase and Coarsegrain so you can test stuff

-- INSERT something to BondBase and Coarsegrain so you can test stuff
-- what did we change last time so we can print stuff from res?
-- add the Utility::checkIfEmpty to the other as well
	- is it same to return zero? 
	- maybe instead of return zeor it should break?
-- Continue with retirveal: PData

-- What if I wan tto retrivev the rest, even thought this particular one doesn't exist?
--structuretechnique and repretype have different, but equally correct implementation of 
retrieveDependencies. Just need to keep only one of them. 
-- I removed wht i have wrote in the RepresentationType::fillInFromResults. I don't 
know if it right as it is at the moment, I need to rethink about this. Same goes for 
PData::fillInFromResults
--std::string PData::selectQueryDataByInfo(DataEnum dat), in line 78: the selectQuery mmust be ast
the one in the last commit. Check that and correct
-- void RepresentationType::fillInFromResults(const Result &res) doesn't nmeed to be there 
apparently
-- for tomorrow: build DataCryoEMInfo::atomicModelByPrimaryId(std::stoi(res[datCryo_id]), db);
etc and make some tests
-- I removed setDataInfo() form PData.h cause it was causing a liner error, but 
it should be on the latest commit, so got and add that back 
-- write RetrieveByDatInfo in PData 
-- there is a contrain in data: you can only have one kind of data at times

----------
18.04.2023
----------
-- Rewrite StructureTechniqueInfo::retrieveDependencies  with the "format" of PData
-- retriveing for maps: result.at("comments")
-- make some test to retrievign e.g. pdf name from files
-- use the insert template you have made
-- write the "fillInFromResults" to other if it's missing 

----------
19.04.2023
----------
-- There is an issue with nmrqualityData and the dependencies on this one, so for now i removed the dependencies. it runs smoothly.
-- I should fill up the dataabase with inserts 

----------
20.04.2023
----------
-- Find a correct way to present the results 
-- continue with the cascade of PDat
-- PRESENTATION


-- Make a Utility  (or maybe just in model or Pmodel):
	-- std::cout << model << std::endl;
-- and ModelDataPair to the retrieve cascade 
-- !!!!!!templating!!!!!!
